                <h2>Lori (Manteuffel) Gibson, M.A.</h2>
                <p>
                    Lori is a school counselor for Spokane Public Schools. She has a Master's in Counseling
                    Psychology from Gonzaga University and a B.A. in Elementary Education/Psychology from
                    Whitworth University. Over the past 28 years she has also worked as a counselor for
                    North Chicago Community HS in Illinois and the Lake Washington School District in
                    Redmond, WA. Lori has led workshops for the past 17 years. She is passionate about the
                    opportunity to support her colleagues in their noble work with students. In a time when
                    high stakes testing seems to take precedence above all, she believes educators must
                    work diligently to focus on the needs of their students. Educators know many of their
                    students face difficulties and these challenges can make it extremely difficult to
                    engage in the learning process. This necessitates that educators be up-to-date on the
                    latest research and have specific strategies to address the needs of their students.
                    The purpose of Loriâ€™s courses is to equip educators for these challenges in a
                    respectful, encouraging, and fun atmosphere.
